# DAILY NOTE
## Wednesday, February 5th, 2025
***
### Rise and Shine

- Bullet Points Only.
- Jot Down Things That Need to Get Done, How Tired You Feel in the Mornings, etc.
- Should be Completed in the Morning. 
- Spend as long as you want. I typically only spend 5 minutes when I actually journal.

### Nighttime Wonders 

##### Emotional Wasteland

- Use for dumping your exact emotions and thoughts about your day.  
- No reflection. That comes later. 
- Bullet points only.

##### Reflect.

- For every single bullet point, reflect on it. 
- What you did differently today, that you didn’t do yesterday, that you could do differently tomorrow?
- Bullet points only.

##### What has killed/inspired motivation today?
- These later questions are more specialized to me, since I want to minmax everything. For your journal, you could probably do something else. For example, if you want to improve in video game design, change these questions to talk about video game design to track your progress and reflect on what you can do to improve. 
- Bullet points only.

##### What strategies should we implement to have more control over our life?
- Reflect. What worked and didn’t work?

###### Change da world. My final message. Goodbye
