# Sample!
***
- Note the cssclasses above (center-images, center-titles, etc.)
- you can make up your own classes, but it takes work 
- The colored folders follow a convention (00, 01, 02, 03, etc.)
	- There is a CSS file somewhere that you would need to tweak if you want more colors 
- Use two $ to use LaTeX

- Go to `Settings > Appearance > CSS Snippets > coloredSidebar` to customize the folder colors you see on the left sidebar (you are going to need a text editor and understand some basic CSS)
